										<h1>Fitbit Anti-Cheating Feature</h1>

                  <h2>Summary</h2>
                  <p>For this project we wanted to find out why people cheat
                    and develop an efficient way to stop it. We focused on
                    encouraging users to use the product in a more productive
                    and consistent way through social accountability. After
                    researching the problems, we scoped our focus down to modifying
                    Fitbit’s app by creating a community and incentive based
                    solution to finalize our idea. Our process involved primary
                    research, secondary research, and qualitative usability
                    testing, which led us to our final solution.</p>

                    <h2>My Role</h2>
                    <p>My project partner, Michael, and I split the work equally.
                      We collaborated on secondary research by focusing on
                      different areas, then I conducted user interviews. Then we
                      compiled our research through affinity diagramming and each
                      creating a persona. We then developed paper prototypes on
                      which Michael conducted usability testing. Finally, Michael
                      compiled the documentation, which I added to and proofread.</p>

									<h2>001. Research</h2>
									<h3>Secondary Research</h3>
                  <blockquote>“If there are loopholes, players find them and exploit them.” – Mike Tinney, CEO of Fitness Interactive Experience</blockquote>
									<p>I began by looking for user problems in the review section for the Pinterest Android app on the Google Play store. This served as a good starting point because many users contributed detailed explanations of what delighted them and what frustrated them. These four reviews stood out because they pointed out specific problems and why they were frustrated.</p>
									<p>We began with secondary research, searching online data on
                    why and how people cheat with their Fitbits. The reasons
                    varied by purpose, from working professionals cheating health
                    insurance to gain incentives and discounts to casual users
                    having a loss of motivation. We gained many important insights
                    from our research. For example, insurance programs were confusing to users –
                    they thought they would have to pay higher premiums if they didn’t
                    meet activity markers, though this was not the case.</p>
                  <p>From there, we looked at a few different areas – why Fitbits
                    are good, why are they bad, and the psychology behind why
                    people cheat. This is where we started to scope down our idea.</p>
                  <p>Our full secondary research can be found <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cl5s0dv19GTUd-ZYCcPmYUx9mnfbf8KlvnwVMuYWWjk/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

                  <h3>Primary Research</h3>
                  <p>Our research provided us with a basis for generating
                    interview questions. We started with a mass list of questions
                    created to supplement what we had found so far. As interviews
                    were conducted, most of these questions adapted – they would
                    change due to the user, what we had learned, and sometimes
                    weren’t asked at all.</p>
                  <p>One of our intentions while conducting interviews was to
                    gain perspectives beyond just current Fitbit users. We
                    interviewed six different users, including those who used
                    fitness tracking apps, people who had stopped using fitness
                    trackers, and people currently using fitness trackers of
                    different models.</p>
                  <blockquote>“You can cheat a Fitbit, but you can’t cheat yourself.” – Zachary Sandberg</blockquote>
                  <p>The interviews provided us with a great deal of information.
                    One of our key insights was that people were motivated to
                    work out less by their fitness trackers but more, in general,
                    by friends who they worked out with. Having someone to keep
                    them accountable provided encouragement and increased inclination to stay fit.</p>

									<h2>002. Affinity Diagramming</h2>
                  <p>Pictures coming soon</p>
                  <p>Once we completed interviews, we aggregated all of the
                    information we had found through affinity diagrams. This
                    allowed to group information we had found in both our
                    primary and secondary research and find common themes. The
                    information was sorted into solutions, why people cheat,
                    how people cheat, why people don’t use their trackers, and
                    motivations to exercise.</p>
                  <p>We also created tried a similar strategy to brainstorm ideas for our persona.
                    This helped us come up with goals/motivations and pain points.</p>

                  <hr class="major" />

  							  <h2>003. Personas</h2>
                  <p>Personas coming soon</p>
                  <p>We created two personas to represent our users. The first,
                    Craig, is a middle-aged CPA who tracks his fitness because
                    his work offers insurance incentives. The second persona is
                    Amanda, a student who bought a fitness tracker to help her
                    keep her New Year’s resolution to lose weight. We decided on
                    creating two broadly different users to remind us that our
                    solution needed to be be widely applicable and useful for a
                    variety of users.</p>

                  <hr class="major" />

    							<h2>004. Prototyping</h2>
                  <p>Pictures coming soon</p>
                  <p>Our next phase was to start prototyping the ideas. We
                    started with ideas that included fit tips, local group sections,
                    and an updated reaction feature. Our base idea was to build
                    sketches that would represent the app’s pages and how they
                    would link to each other. We felt that focusing our changes
                    around our app would allow for easy adaptations during our
                    user testing. Also, the Fitbit app is an existing platform
                    that many users are already familiar with.</p>
                  <p>Our guiding idea during prototyping was to create features
                    to help users meet other users and exercise together. We
                    decided to pursue this because of the insights from our
                    interviews on how users tend to exercise more often when
                    they have groups. Group psychology can be a very powerful motivator.</p>

                  <hr class="major" />

                  <h2>005. Usability Testing</h2>
                  <p>Pictures coming soon</p>
                  <p>During usability testing, we were able find where the design
                    failed to communicate and where it really missed the points
                    we were looking to improve. One thing that was brought up was
                    that our solution seemed like a temporary fix to larger problem at hand.</p>
                  <p>Additionally, we found some flaws regarding our original
                    prototype. We found that we were missing slides for features
                    when mapping out the app. Secondly, we found out that with
                    the addition of so many new features, navigating between them
                    was a hassle and caused unnecessary friction in the flow.</p>
                  <p>We mapped out our flow to help understand where the interface had become complicated and how we could improve it.</p>

                  <hr class="major" />

                  <h2>006. Results</h2>
                  <p>Our first testing revealed that there were missing screens
                    and an overwhelming amount of features. There were also too
                    many scenarios to feasibly test effectively in the time
                    constraints. This led us to cut the tips, upgraded reactions,
                    and local routes features in order to streamline the functionality
                    and purpose of the design.</p>
                  <p>Our second testing showed that the design was easier to navigate.
                    The new testing also  showed us that the steps to get from page
                    to page seemed more intuitive than our initial design.</p>

                    <hr class="major" />

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>By focusing on the social psychology aspect of motivation,
                      we were able to create a good starting point with our prototype.
                      In the future, to further develop this idea, we would like to
                      conduct more research on group psychology to understand what
                      makes them powerful and motivating. We would also simplify our
                      prototype to create more focused features to accomplish our goal,
                      instead of spreading it out. Fewer features could more effectively
                      and more easily accomplish the same goal.</p>
